# Red Alert is a game that allows the player to progress through 15 levels by clicking the red star
# With each level completed the number of stars of other colors increases 
# There is only one red star per level
# If a star of another color is clicked then the player loses and a screen displays a game over message
# If the player completes all levels then a screen displays the message that the player won
# The game over and game complete screens also allow the player to play again by pressing the space bar
